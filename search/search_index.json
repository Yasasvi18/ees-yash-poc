This token is valid for 60 minutes. You will use these credentials to authenticate when making requests to endpoints that respond with Verisk EES protected information.</p> <p>For more information about generating token via Postman or using Powershell, check out the Authentication and Authorization page. </p> <p>Step 3: Upload data</p> <p>Follow the instructions in the welcome email to deploy the installer agent. Next, create a folder with read and write access, then copy all the files you want to upload to the shared platform. The installer agent will automatically sync all files from your folder to the shared platform in Synergy Studio. </p> <p>Step 4: Make your first request</p> <p>From the available endpoints, select the import exposures API request.
